# in some case maybe we want convert results calculation likes float number to decimal so we will learning in here

x = 1
y = 2.8

print(int(x * y))
print(float(x * y))
print(complex(x * y))

# or we want convert instantly to another type number

a = 2.8
b = 7

# convert

j = int(a)
k = float(b)
l = complex(a)

print(type(j))
print(type(k))
print(l, type(l))
# for some notes if we want convert complex number to another types we may need more codes
