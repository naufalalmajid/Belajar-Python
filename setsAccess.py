# in sets we cannot access by index value, because sets is unindexed, so we can using for loop or in keywords
x = {"belajar", "konsisten", "mulai", "sekarang"}
for a in x:
    print(a)

# or we can check using in if some values present in set
print("konsisten" in x)

# for remember in sets we cannt change values but we can add new items into sets
